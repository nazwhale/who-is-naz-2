Susie and me walked into the ice cream parlour. It was called ‘Sundae Morning’. Susie giggled. I did not.

We met the owner, a bland, featureless man by the name of Jones. His shop was completely devoid of decoration or colour, save for the ice cream itself. Jones explained his philosophy with eloquence and pride.

"Folks don’t come here for chairs and tables; don’t come here for little glittery decorations. Hell, folks don’t even come here for Jones.

"People come here for one thing – that glorious icey-cream right in fronta ya.

"Now if I had all that shiii-at…", he gestured wildly to his empty parlour, "People wouldn’t be looking at my icey-cream, they’d be looking at all the shiii-at.

"Folks come here and they can’t help themselves but look at one thing and one thing only: icey-cream."

This reminded me of a lecture I’d once attended on relativity. A fusty old chap had reeled off how us humans find it impossible to value things without comparing them to other things.

In its gloomy décor, Jones’ shop was a prime example. Most icey-cream selections are merely pleasing to the eye, colourful. Nice.

In the greyness around it, Jones’ _beamed_.
