![splitty lifeline thing](https://i.imgur.com/lIlzMxy.png)

The middle line is your life, constructed by you filling in your experiences. Let's call it your lifeline.

The lines on the left are other people joining an experience with you. For example, when I started my current job there'd be a bunch of lines coming in to meet my lifeline from the left.

The intersection of those lines aim to reflect how my experiences and the experiences of everyone at work are shared for a short while.

The lines on the right are other people’s lifelines that have diverged with yours. If I leave my job, the lifelines of the people I currently work with would fly off to the right as our lives go off in different directions.

I suppose big life events would trigger a big clump of divergences. Normally I guess there’d be a trickle as some people leave work, drop out of school, move to another country.

When you hover over an experience (i.e. a portion of your lifeline) a little info thingy might show what it was you were doing and how many other users also have that same experience in their lifeline.

Perhaps you could add other people to an experience and it’d invite them by showing them a partially filled line, prompting them to fill in the gaps.

Perhaps other people filling in their lifelines could make your own lifeline richer, by lengthening the lifelines flying off to the left and right.

Here's where it gets interesting.

In the bottom half, beyond the present, each line represents a possible future.

Some of those the user can fill in. Perhaps they see themselves leaving their job in a few months, moving to South America, or simply continuing along the same path.

The system then generates potential futures that the user might not have considered based on the lives of other users. And those lives also diverge to certain paths, and the divergences diverge and so on.

So you'll see not only your future plans, but where those plans could lead to based on real lives from the past.

Perhaps plans that have materialised for more people are bolder in the design. Perhaps alternate future plans are generated for you, so that you might consider life paths that you'd not previously thought of.
