![oily veg on toast](https://imgur.com/5IrUKSX)

A little while back I started keeping jars of oily veg in my fridge, 'cos they’re healthy and last forever. The sorts of jars you see on the shelves of Turkish shops and that.

I started using these jars of oily goodness for my midnight snacks. What happened was so good. It felt like cheating.

## **Steps**

1. Get your jars out, chop up some of what’s inside
2. Toast some bread
3. Put your stuff on the toast
4. Cover with lots of olive oil and salt and pepper
5. You just made a fancy bruschetta type thing in 5 minutes

## **Foods**

Here’s some of the sorts of things that work well. You don’t need all of them by any means, pick a few.

That said, you can really pile it on if you’re feeling fancy.

Something tart and salty against something fresh and herby is a good bet. A bit of spice and tang will transport you to lip-smacking levels.

**Veg in jars**

* Red pepper
* Artichokes
* Sun-dried tomatoes (yeah yeah tomatoes are fruit whatever go away)

**Veg not in jars**

* Roast aubergine
* Olives
* Cherry tomatoes (still not listening)
* Garlic

**Herby things**

* Oregano
* Rosemary
* Basil

**Not herby things**

* Any crumbly cheese (manchego, feta, etc.)
* Lemon juice
* Chilli flakes
